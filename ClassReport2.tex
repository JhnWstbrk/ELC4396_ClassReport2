% Formatting defined by class file
\documentclass[11pt]{article}

% ---- Document formatting ----
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}	% Narrower margins
\usepackage{booktabs}				% Nice formatting of tables
\usepackage{graphicx}				% Ability to include graphics

%\setlength\parindent{0pt}	% Do not indent first line of paragraphs 
\usepackage[parfill]{parskip}		% Line space b/w paragraphs
%	parfill option prevents last line of pgrph from being fully justified

% Parskip package adds too much space around titles, fix with this
\RequirePackage{titlesec}

\title{System on Chip: Class Report 2}
\author{Noel Sengel and John Westbrook}

\maketitle


\section*{Summary}

In this class report, our goal was to create a reaction game using an LED on our NEXYS board. Once the LED lit up, a timer started to see how long it took the person playing to press a button and react. To accomplish this, we took code from a previous class which converted binary to Binary Coded Decimal and displayed it on the 7 segment display. Then, we added our own code and editted the modules to display the millisecond timer while it was running. Our main development occured in one module, "reaction\_timer".


\section*{Results}

Here is a test we did for reaction\_timer module which ensures its functionality

\end{figure}

In this GitHub link provided below, there is a video of our board working mostly as desired. As of the writing of this report, we are struggling to have "Hi" displayed before the game starts and some other overflow when pressing the button before the LED goes off.
\section*{Code}

Here is the GitHub repo with our modules: 
\url{https://github.com/JhnWstbrk/ELC4396_ClassReport2}

In Listing 1, you can see a section of our main module, "reaction\_timer", which is the main logic that implements the game part.
